Building: `gcc -o server *.c`
Running: `./server <server port> <server root directory>`
Description: Server runs continually receiving requests from mulitple clients, forking as needed, and attempts to handle them.
            Server only accepts GET requests. Otherwise, it sends a 400 Bad Request response to the client. 
            Only html, txt, jpg and gif file extensions are supported. Otherwise, it sends a 404 Not Found response to the client.
            Additionally, if the file requested is not found, we also respond with 404 Not Found.
Limitations: The most obvious is that of file support. Only 4 file extensions are supported. Also, the headers sent back are very basic and do not
            include Content-Length or anything else that is more advanced.
